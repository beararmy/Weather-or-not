# Weather-or-not

In the process of being moved to strava-tools repo

Tool to help decide whether to cycle commute or not based on weather conditions.
- Wind
- Rain
- Temperature

Still need to add;
- Second block of code to check the return journey (time should be configurable)
- Method of alerting about the return journey (maybe? .. if you're at work already you have to get home)
- Section to get an oauth key with spotify (Already worked with a session once I have this key, but that was interactively gained)
- Pre-work emails
- Triggering of bedside light at the relevant time (assume I can tie into HomeAssistant)
- Proper documentation block at the top
